# period_analysis
In this project we analyze,using the Python programming language, the period of variable stars using a file type lc0000.data extracted by the observations made by the TESS satellite.
We create a plot of the light curve, the periodogram and the folded light curve, that is the light curve adpted at the most plausible period calculated in this project.
This is an example of the output of this program:
