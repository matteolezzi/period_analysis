# period_analysis
In this project we Analyze the period of variable stars using a file type lc0000.data extracted by the observation made by the TESS satellite using the Python programming language.
We create a plot of the light curve, the periodogram and the folded light curve, that is the light curve adpted at the most plausible period calculated in this project.
This is an example of the output of this program:
